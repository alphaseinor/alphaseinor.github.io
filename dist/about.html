        <h3 class="text-secondary">Passions</h3>
        <p>Like most geeks, I have multiple (sometimes conflicting) professional passions:</p>
        <p>Computer Programming</p>
        <p>Drafting and Design</p>
        <p>Automotive Technology</p>
      </div>
      <div class="job job-1">
        <h3>Computer Programming</h3>
        <h6>Javascript: Node.js, React, SASS, Express.js</h6>
        <p>I started developing Javascript in 2001, I had a love/hate relationship with JS ever since. Just recently, when ES6
          was released I was once again enchanted by it's simple to use, hard to master ways. I also have some Angular 2
          experience, but don't have anything in my portfolio at this time</p>
        <h6>DOM: HTML5, CSS3</h6>
        <p>Okay, so HTML and CSS3 are not programming languages, they are markup and style sheets. I'm willing to bet, even
          C++ developers need to know this stuff, so I do as well. </p>
        <h6>C++</h6>
        <p>I learned C++, like many other people in College. I have developed multiple applicatons for BeOS, I mostly use this
          in my arduino development. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>Drafting and Design</h3>
        <h6>Fusion 360</h6>
        <p>After I learned autocad, I breifly was able to use a competing parametric CAD (pro-e). I loved the software, however
          it was too pricy for a home hobbyist, same with solidworks. When Autodesk came out with Fusion 360, and made it
          free (for the most part) to hobbyists I switched immediately. I currently don't get in there very often, but when
          I do, I generally make custom Mini-ITX computer cases for my friends and family</p>
        <h6>AutoCAD</h6>
        <p>I started working with AutoCAD in the 1990's with version 12, and kept up with the software until AutoCAD 2014. I
          have designed multiple computer enclosures using it's drafting board like features. I have since left AutoCAD for
          Fusion 360.</p>
        <h6>3D Printing</h6>
        <p>I own a Creality CR-10 printer. I have printed using ABS, PLA, and TPU. Mostly I use it for Computer case parts,
          and for VW heater door "foam fix kits"</p>
      </div>
      <div class="job job-3">
        <h3>Automotive Technology</h3>
        <h6>VW Registered Technician</h6>
        <p>I've been working on my VWs since I was a kid, My first one was a 1984 grey market GTI. I owned that one for about
          2 years, then got into other imports. I got bit by the Diesel bug in 1995 with the Passat TDI debut. Fast forward
          to 2004 I pick up a used 1999 Golf TDI AT; My life has been with VW ever since. I have owned a TDI that, at the
          time it sold had 750,000 miles.</p>
